- Keys pressed: *`<Command-C><Command-V><enter>`*
- I have my ssh login for ieng6 saved on a separate tab on my computer, so I simply copied the command using `<Command-C>` and pasted it into the terminal using `Command-V`. Then, I hit `<enter>` to run the command and was able to successfully login.

### 2. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

- Keys pressed: typed `git clone`,*`<Command-C><Command-V><enter>`*
- `git clone` is the command used to clone a repository. Then, I simply copied the ssh link from the repository from my Github account using `<Command-C>` and pasted it into the terminal using `<Command-V>`. Then , I hit `<enter>` to run the command and was able to successfully clone my fork of the repository from my Github account.

- The `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` command was 5 up in my search history, so I used the `<up>` arrow key to access it. I hit `<enter>` to run the compile command. Then, the `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestListExamples` command was 5 up in my search history, so I used `<up>` to accessed it the same way. Finally, I hit `<enter>` to run the command and was able to successfully run the tests.

### 4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
